Wille is a highly customizeable toolkit made to be lightweight.
For the ping tool to function after use you need to delete the PINGT folder
OR 
edit the run.bat file manually
pa.bat creates random files with random number strings, if space is really
an issue dont run it!!
More useful tools coming soon when I'm smart
This is the super secret awesome special alt. version (GX) that generally
is more lightweight and has more functionality
It's still recommended to download an installer package since they have the
requirements to do anything Wille can't (probably)
You can find each version of Wille and the Installer packages at:
