Wille is a highly customizeable toolkit made to be lightweight.
It's advised to run the Exit Wille function once done as it deletes all
temporary files
More useful tools coming soon when I'm smart
This is the lightest weight and most functional version (XR) that is just
a modified version of the previous (GX)
It's still recommended to download an installer package since they have the
requirements to do anything Wille can't (probably)
You can find each version of Wille and the installer packages at:
